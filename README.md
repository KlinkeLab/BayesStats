Author: David Klinke, West Virginia University

R Markdown files for introducing Bayesian Statistics and Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods using R.

This collection is comprised of a series of Markdown files that progress over the following topics:
1) Bayesian approaches to common inferential questions involving:

    a) Binomial distributed random variable

    b) Gaussian distributed random variable

    c) Poisson distributed random variable

    d) Linear regression

    e) Some related solved problems 

3) Bayesian approaches coupled with Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods to solve:

    a) General discussion

    b) Linear regression problems

    c) Regression problem involving ordinary differential equations (still needs work)

    d) Regression problem involving differential algebraic equations

4) Exploratory data analysis involving:

    a) Principal component analysis
