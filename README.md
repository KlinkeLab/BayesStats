    a) Binomial distributed random variable

    b) Gaussian distributed random variable

    c) Poisson distributed random variable

    d) linear regression

2) Bayesian approaches coupled with Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods to solve:

    a) General disussion

    b) Linear regression problems

    c) Regression problem involving ordinary differential equations

    d) Regression problem involving differential algebraic equations
